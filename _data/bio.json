Students are challenges to explore how STEM works in their world while working as a team to solve problems in their community. Teams compete virtually in state and regional competitions and in-person through the National Judging & Educational Event (NJ&EE) in June 2020. Student prizes are awarded at the state, regional, and national levels by grade level. My team won for the west region and we were one of the five teams invited to Washington D.C to compete at a national level."
