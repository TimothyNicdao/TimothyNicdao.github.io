Many college students have limited kitchen resources, limited cooking skills, limited time, limited access to grocery stores, and no access to creative recipes that respect these constraints. As a result, college students spend money to eat out, or eat non-healthy foods at fast food places or through vending machines. Healthy Manoa creates a way for students (on-campus or off) to learn and share recipes  that is healthy, cheap and reliable.
