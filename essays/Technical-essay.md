By taking the class ICS 314, Software Engineering at the University of Hawaii, I have learned many things. Perhaps the most important thing I learned was functional programming. At first, I came into the class ready to learn, thinking I was a highly functioning programmer. Then we started learning functional programming and I immediately started wondering why I have never used this style of programming before. The ability to break your methods into little, reusable pieces was beautiful, almost as beautiful the skies in Hawaii or the girl in one of my classes (*wink*). I was no longer writing spaghetti code and instead, I started thinking more of how I can write functions that I can use over and over again in order to alleviate writing too much code. As a result, the code I write now is much cleaner and easier to understand, although not as delicious as spaghetti code. 
	
Speaking of cleaner code, another thing we learned in software engineering is code quality. For programming noobs out there who have only written a hello world program before, how your code looks actually matter (shocking!). It matters because teamwork is absolutely necessary for software engineering and if only you can understand your code, then it is meaningless. For projects, especially large scale projects, multiple people will work on the codebase and writing unreadable code is just like leaving your roommate to wash dishes. For ICS 314, we learned to use AirBnB’s code style and it worked like magic. Even now, I still don’t really know how to style my code to adhere to EsLint standards, I just type away then run a script on the console in order to fix my code and like I said, it is magic. 

Another tool that we used in 314 was UI frameworks. During the first month of the semester, we were forced to learn HTML and CSS. HTML was interesting to learn because I finally started learning the ‘language of the web’ but CSS tried to bring out my non-existent artistic side and completely and utterly failed. For those who don’t know what CSS is, it is basically make-up for your HTML, elevating your basic websites to Kylie Jenner status. Although to this day, I still don’t know what Kylie Jenner does, I learned what UI frameworks are through this class. UI Frameworks essentially make-up artists that do your make-up for you. All you have to do is tell the framework what you want to see and the framework automatically styles your HTML using CSS, minus the hassle. 

Overall, I have learned a lot from ICS 314 but now if you'll excuse me, I must go back home to my first love Java and back-end development.
