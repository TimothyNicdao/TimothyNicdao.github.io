An app or a web app that allows people of similar interest to meet. For example if they like video games, we can conncect them with other people who also likes video games and through the app, they can set up a meeting in order to meet new people. The problem is people who may be new to UH may not have people to hang out with and by matching people with others that have similar interests, making friends have never been easier. With this kind of app, there are few problems that may arise. The one that comes to mind are predatory people posing as college students. To fix this we issue, we can implement checks to make sure that only UH affiliated people can use a certain section of the app. The reason why we don’t restrict the whole app to only UH affiliates is because friendships can be formed outside the school but there are more risks involved so students can choose for themselves whether they are willing to meet people outside of UH.

One example page we can do is when users are grouped together for a meetup, they can all see each other’s information which will be displayed by cards. We can also allow people to add friends with people they have already met so that they can set up their own events if they wanted.
